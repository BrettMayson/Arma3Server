An Arma 3 Dedicated Server. Updates to the latest version every time it is restarted.

## Usage

### Docker CLI

```s
    docker create \
        --name=arma-server \
        -p 2302:2302/udp \
        -p 2303:2303/udp \
        -p 2304:2304/udp \
        -p 2305:2305/udp \
        -p 2306:2306/udp \
        -v path/to/missions:/arma3/mpmissions \
        -v path/to/configs:/arma3/configs \
        -v path/to/mods:/arma3/mods \
        -v path/to/servermods:/arma3/servermods \
        -e ARMA_CONFIG=main.cfg \
        -e STEAM_USER=myusername \
        -e STEAM_PASSWORD=mypassword \
        synixebrett/arma3server
```

### docker-compose

Use the docker-compose.yml file inside a folder. It will automatically create 4 folders in which the missions, configs, mods and servermods can be loaded.

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`, containing at least `STEAM_USER` and `STEAM_PASSWORD`.

Use `docker-compose start` to start the server.

Use `docker-compose logs` to see server logs.

Use `docker-compose down` to shutdown the server.

The `network_mode: host` can be changed to explicit ports if needed.

Use `docker-compose up -d` to start the server, detached.

See [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose) for an installation guide.

Profiles are saved in `/arma3/configs/profiles`

### Example

`-e ARMA_CDLC="csla;gm;vn;ws"`

## Loading mods

### Local

1. Place the mods inside `/mods` or `/servermods`.
2. Be sure that the mod folder is all lowercase and does not show up with quotation marks around it when listing the directory eg `'@ACE(v2)'`
3. Run the following command from the mods and/or servermods directory to confirm that all the files are lowercase.
    `find . -depth -exec rename 's/(.*)\/([^\/]*)/$1\/\L$2/' {} \;`
    If this is NOT the case, the mods will prevent the server from booting.
4. Make sure that each mod contains a lowercase `/addons` folder. This folder also needs to be lowercase in order for the server to load the required PBO files inside.
5. Start the server.

### Workshop

Set the environment variable `MODS_PRESET` to the HTML preset file exported from the Arma 3 Launcher. The path can be local file or a URL. A volume can be created at `/arma3/steamapps/workshop/content/107410` to preserve the mods between containers.

`-e MODS_PRESET="my_mods.html"`

`-e MODS_PRESET="http://example.com/my_mods.html"`
